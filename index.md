### Course Description and Objectives

Calculus studies two ideas, the effects of the way things change and the idea of the mathematical infinite. In your previous high school calculus course, you have encountered these ideas in finding the derivative of a function or taking its integral. This course will continue in a slightly different setting, which is series and differential equations. We expect that our collective backgrounds are quite varied, so in the first week or so, we will come together playing catch-up for some, and doing review for others. After a brief review of differentiation and integration, we will introduce the ideas of probability and develop series and series representations of functions. We will end our course with an introduction to differential equations, with its applications in geometry, physics, economics, biology, you name it...

We will focus on problem solving skills and coherent writing. The course will have a slightly more theoretical flavor than your high school calculus courses, and the problems may be more sophisticated (but you are better prepared for this). You are expected to be Maple literate. 

### Grading :
Your semester grade for this course will be determined by me based off my assessment of your overall performance in the course. Scores from the block final exam will be used in order to guage the performance of this section as a whole in comparison to other sections. This block grading system helps to ensure consistency of the meaning of letter grades across all sections of Math 122L. As a result of this policy, any letter grade assigned to assessments prior to the final exam should be considered an estimate. Your final grade in this course will be roughly comprised of the following: <br>

Labs and Projects 20% <br>
Homework and quizzes 10% <br>
Midterms 40% <br>
Final Exam 30% <br>

To see a detailed description of grading in lab calculus courses, please reference the document titled Block Calculus Course Policies, which can be found on the Piazza site.

### Assignments:

* Reading mini-quizzes: <br>
Before each class, you will be expected to read the section in the text for that class. After that class, you should study the materials we did in  class critically, and read the text again. On every Tuesday's class, you will be asked to complete a mini-quiz with a question on the reading for that day, or on what we did in the preceding class. No make-up quizzes will be given, although I will drop the lowest grade. 

* Daily problem sets:  <br>
The homework problems are assigned after each lesson and collected the following class.  You are encouraged to collaborate with others in the course, use the resources of the help room and the Piazza course site. But your written solutions must be your own, reflecting your own personal understanding. Late homework will not be accepted. 

* Lab reports: <br>
You will either have an individual quiz or be required to hand in a group report on your work in the following week's lab. 

### Midterms and Final Exam:
There will be three in-class midterms and one final in the exam period in this course.  These exams are scheduled on the following dates: 

*  Test 1: Thursday, Sep 22 <br>
*  Test 2: Thursday, Oct 27 <br>
*  Test 3: Thursday, Dec 1 <br>
*  Final: 9am-noon, Thursday, Dec 15 <br>

Calculators are not allowed in all quizzes, midterms and exams. However, in the final exam, you are allowed to bring one standard-size sheet (front and back) with whatever formulas or notes you would like. 

### Absences:
There will be no make-up exams nor rescheduled exams, except excused by your dean in the following cases:

* serious illness only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean. <br>
* serious illness or death in the family only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean. <br>
* athletic commitments or religious obligations only if documentation is provided with a written excuse from your dean and prior notice is given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken before the rest of the class.  

### Duke Community Standard: 
Students are expected to adhere to the [Duke Community Standard](http://integrity.duke.edu/new.html) . If a student is found responsible for academic dishonesty on a graded assignment, I reserve the right to assign a grade of zero to the assignment in question and to further reduce the final grade for the course by one or more letter grades possibly to a failing grade.
